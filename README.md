# rotary encoder example

This is a simple example of using python to handle a rotary encoder, specifically the `PEC11 - 4 0 20 F - S 0012` that I bought from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/377).

## Virtual Environment

I like to use virtualenv when I work on python, even on sometime small like a RaspberryPi. Using venv helps keep experimenting with different libraries clean.

```
# Create a project directory and a python3 virtual env:
mkdir myproject
python3 -m venv myproject

# Clone this repo
...
```
